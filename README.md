# StripperCS2-MapFixes
A compilation of movement maps that have been fixed using StripperCS2.

I will add more maps as I go. Feel free to make a PR if you want to contribute!

An example of implementing these files: `addons/StripperCS2/maps/surf_aircontrol_ksf/default_ents.jsonc`

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/SharpTimer/StripperCS2-MapFixes/wiki) if you want to see how you can do this yourself.
